# create a wiperware that deletes all files in a directory
# and then deletes the directory itself
# this is a very dangerous script, so be careful when using it
# it is recommended to use it on a test directory first
# to make sure it works as expected
# you can use the following command to create a test directory
# mkdir /tmp/test
# and then run the script to see what happens
# python3 wiperware.py /tmp/test
# the script will delete all files in the directory and then
# delete the directory itself
